# TicTacToe

Introduction:
- This is a standard TicTacToe java project where you go against a computer.
- There isn't a difficulty that you select, you just play and go from there.

When you get to the code part of this repository:
- All the code you will need is under the src folder.
- The only class that isn't needed in that file is the Main class.

How to run the code:
- You have to have the play class up in order to run the code(atleast for IntelliJ).

When the code is ran:
- Click in the console so you can input a number for the marker you want (X or O's).
- If you type in 1, you get to be X.
- If you type in 2, you get to be O.

- Once you have selected which marker you want, it will select a number between 1 and 2 to choose whether the computer or you go first.

- In order to make your move, you will need to first input a row (1 - 3).
- Then you will need to input a column (1 - 3) to place a marker on the board.
- Example: Let's say you do row 1, column 1. Your marker will be placed in the top left because that's where the board starts.

- Then just keep playing until you lose, draw, or win against the computer.
- When you lose, draw, or win. The console will ask you to input the number 1 or 2.
- If you type in 1, you play again.
- If you type in 2, you exit the code.
